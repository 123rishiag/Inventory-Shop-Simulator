# Inventory-Shop Simulator

This project is a shop and inventory management system with interactive gameplay mechanics. Players can trade items, gather resources. The system is designed using **Service Locator**, **Dependency Injection**, **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**, and the **Observer Pattern**, ensuring modularity and scalability.

---

## Gameplay Elements

### **1. Item Types**
- **Materials**: Resources used for crafting or trading.
- **Weapons**: Combat-related items for attack or defense.
- **Consumables**: Items that provide temporary boosts or effects (e.g., potions).
- **Treasure**: Rare and valuable items that can significantly increase the player's currency.

### **2. Rarity Types**
- **Very Common**: Frequently found items with low value and minimal impact.
- **Common**: Standard items with moderate value.
- **Rare**: Valuable items that are less frequently available.
- **Epic**: High-value items with significant gameplay effects.
- **Legendary**: Extremely rare and valuable items with unique properties.

### **3. Inventory Constraints**
- **Maximum Weight**: The cumulative weight of items in the inventory must not exceed the player's capacity.
- **Dynamic Weight Updates**: Inventory weight updates dynamically with every item added or removed.
- **Weight-Dependent Gameplay**: Actions like resource gathering are disabled when the inventory is full.

### **4. Currency System**
- Players start with no money.
- Currency increases when items are sold.
- Currency decreases when items are bought.
- Displayed dynamically in the UI for real-time feedback.

### **5. Gameplay Enhancements**
- **Gather Resources**:
  - Button allows players to collect random resources based on rarity.
  - Disabled when the inventory reaches maximum weight.

- **Buy/Sell Mechanics**:
  - **Buying**: Requires sufficient currency and available weight in the inventory.
  - **Selling**: Adds currency and frees up inventory weight.

### **6. UI Components**
- **Shop Tabs**: All, Materials, Weapons, Consumables, and Treasure.
- **Item Panel**: Shows item details like icon, description, rarity, type, weight, quantity and price.
- **Notifications**: Popups for insufficient currency, full inventory, or successful transactions.

### **7. Sound and Feedback**
- Sounds are triggered during transactions, errors, and resource gathering.
- Temporary overlays for actions like "You bought [Item Name]" or "You sold [Item Name]" improve clarity.

### **8. Requirements to Features Mapping**
| **Requirement**               | **Implemented Feature**                                                                  |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Item types (Materials, etc.)   | Shop tabs categorized by item type.                                                     |
| Rarity system                  | Randomized resource gathering based on rarity proportional to inventory weight.         |
| Inventory weight constraints   | Dynamic weight updates; maximum weight prevents further actions like buying/gathering.  |
| Buy/Sell mechanics             | Transaction logic integrated with sound and UI feedback.                                |
| Notifications                  | Popups for insufficient currency or weight limits.                                      |

### **9. Item Properties**
- **Icon**: Visual representation of the item.
- **Description**: Text detailing the item's purpose.
- **Buying Price**: Cost of the item in the shop.
- **Selling Price**: Price of the item when sold.
- **Weight**: Weight of one quantity of the item.
- **Type**: Type of the item (Materials, etc.).
- **Rarity**: Determines availability and gameplay impact.
- **Quantity**: Number of items owned or available.

### **10. Player Progression**
- Start with an empty inventory and no money.
- Gather resources to build inventory and earn currency.
- Buy rare or useful items to maximize value and efficiency.
- Sell less valuable items to manage inventory weight and increase currency.

## Design Patterns and Programming Principles

### 1. **Service Locator**: 
- A private service locator in `GameService` is responsible for instantiating and managing all other services which centralizes service access, reducing dependencies and increasing modularity.

### 2. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**:
- Each service (`UIService`, `ItemService`, `InventoryService`, `ShopService`) is structured into MVC components which promotes separation of concerns, making the system modular and scalable.

### 3. **Observer Pattern**:
- `EventService` acts as the mediator for communication between all services using events that leads to decoupled services, enabling event-driven updates.

### 4. **Programming Principles**:
- **Dependency Injection**: Event service is passed in all services as parameter, ensuring flexibility and reducing coupling.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Every file has one defined responsibility for clarity and maintainability.

## Architectural Overview

Below is the block diagram illustrating the architecture:

---

### Services and Components

1. **Game Service**: The central service responsible for initializing all other services using a private Service Locator.
   
2. **Event Service**: Implements the Observer Pattern for event-driven communication. It manages all events acting as mediators between services.
   - **Controller**: Inherits from EventController to manage event registrations and notifications.

3. **Sound Service**: Handles immersive sound effects for actions like buying/selling and resource gathering.
   - **Scriptable Objects**: 
      - `SoundScriptableObject` centralizes sound configurations.

4. **UI Service**: Handles user interactions and dynamically updates UI elements like inventory and shop panels.
   - **Controller**: Manages user interactions and dynamic UI updates.
   - **Model**: Placeholder for future enhancements.
   - **View**: Handles rendering of UI panels dynamically.

5. **Item Service**: Manages item-related data and logic, including creation of Item Controllers.
   - **Controller**: Handles item-related actions (e.g., create, delete).
   - **Model**: Stores runtime item data (e.g., weight, rarity).
   - **View**: Manages item visual representation in the UI.
   - **Scriptable Objects**: 
     - `ItemScriptableObject`: Centralized data for item properties.
     - `ItemDatabaseScriptableObject`: Manages a collection of items for use in the game.

6. **Inventory Service**: Initializes inventory panel.
   - **Controller**: Handles inventory constraints like weight, currency and manages selling logic.
   - **Model**: Tracks inventory contents and runtime updates.
   - **View**: Displays inventory items dynamically.

## Events

Here are the key events used in the system and their descriptions:

1. **Item Service**:
   - `OnCreateItemEvent`: Creates and returns an item controller for the specified section.

2. **Item Controller**:
   - `OnShowItemEvent`: Displays items of a specific type (Materials etc.) in a section (Shop/Inventory).
   - `OnDestroyItemEvent`: Removes an item from a section (Shop/Inventory).

3. **Shop Controller**:
   - `OnShopAddItemEvent`: Adds an item to the shop when selling from inventory.
   - `OnBuyItemEvent`: Triggers the item-buying logic.

4. **Inventory Controller**:
   - `OnInventoryAddItemEvent`: Adds an item to inventory when buying from the shop.
   - `OnSellItemEvent`: Triggers the item-selling logic.

5. **UI Controller**:
   - `OnBuySellButtonClickEvent`: Handles buy/sell button clicks and their respective actions.
   - `OnShopUpdatedEvent`: Updates the Shop UI dynamically.
   - `OnInventoryUpdatedEvent`: Updates the Inventory UI dynamically.

## Script and Asset Hierarchy

1. **Scripts**:
   - Organized by feature: `Editor`, `Event`, `Main`, `UI`, `Inventory`, `Shop`, `Items`, `Sound`, etc.

2. **Assets**:
   - **Sounds**: From Outscal.
   - **Prefabs**: Self-created for UI components.
   - **Art**:
     - `Art/UI Icons/Item`: Organized into folders for each item type (e.g., Materials, Weapons, Consumables, Treasure).
     - Icons were generated via ChatGPT for consistency.
